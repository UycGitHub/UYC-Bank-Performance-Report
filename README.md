# UYC Bank Performance Report

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of various loan types (Consumer Loan, Car Loan, Housing Loan) across different regions and branches of a bank. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help management monitor progress toward targets and guide future decisions.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
There was a need to understand how each loan type was performing at the branch and regional level relative to predefined goals. Without a centralized and visual approach, identifying underperforming areas was difficult.

## 📊 Data Description
- **Source**: Excel spreadsheet (prepared for training purposes)
- **Fields**: Region, Location, Branch Name, Branch Code
- **Measures Created**: Consumer Loan, Car Loan, Housing Loan (custom DAX measures)

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- **Tool Used**: Power BI
- **Steps Taken**:
  - Data imported from Excel
  - Transformations applied using Power Query
  - DAX measures created to analyze loan performance
  - Filters and relationships set for branch and region-level reporting

## 📈 Key Insights
- Loan performance was visualized across all regions and branches.
- Branches closer or further from their targets were easily identified.
- Underperforming regions became candidates for deeper investigation and support.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Launch regional or branch-specific credit campaigns and marketing efforts for underperforming areas.
- Use the dashboard regularly to track progress toward strategic sales goals.
